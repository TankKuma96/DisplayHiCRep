Description: Although Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide
        chromatin interactions, it is too expensive. Thus,HiChIP, a more 
        affordable technology, has been developed. However, there are still 
        no statistically robust methods to evaluate the reproducibility of 
        HiChIP data.The current methods for assessing HiChIP data 
        reproducibility can produce misleading results since the 3D spatial 
        structure of genome. Our lab's PhD student Tao already create a 
        method for calculating the reproducibility called 'hicrep'. After 
        evaluation, we made sure that Hicrep is also workable for HiChIP 
        data. Thus, we improve it to take more common HiChIP data types 
        and display those results in heat map. This R package 'DisplayHiCRep' 
        implements our approach.
